        <h2>How I "cracked the code" on finding a Dream Job</h2>
        <p id="ihdb5z" class="c10171">
          I remember watching “Office Space” and thinking,
          <b>“This is the scariest movie I’ve ever seen.”</b> I do not want to
          end up sitting in a cubicle 40 years from now repairing printers.
          NO!!!
        </p>
        <p id="i7c7sk" class="c10207">
          That’s why when I was in college, I started a weird hobby. I got
          together with a small group of friends to learn how to “beat” the
          interviewing process.
        </p>
        <p id="it42rb" class="c10225">
          We interviewed at the world's best companies — Google, McKinsey, Bain,
          etc. — and tested everything. Interview answers. Negotiation
          techniques. Even body language. Then we came back and shared our
          results with each other in our closed circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weird, yes...but I never wanted to end up in a drab, gray cubicle.
          Ever.

        <div class="spacer c57434"></div>
        <p><b>Why do all this?</b></p>
        <p>
          Because I was sick of reading all the standard job advice (that never
          seemed to actually work). You've heard these tips before too. Things
          like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adjust the font on your resume!</li>
          <li>Make sure to use 1.5” margins, not (gasp) 1” margins!</li>
          <li>
            Apply to a lot of companies! In fact, “shotgun” your resume out to
            dozens of companies (only to never hear back).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I would watch people doing this, constantly frustrated that it never
          worked...<i>only to keep doing the same thing over and over</i>.
          WHY!?!
        </p>
        <p>
          Pretty soon, my friends and I became very, very good at landing highly
          competitive jobs. I'm talking about getting job offer after job offer
          and negotiating tens of thousands of dollars in raises.

          <b>Once we cracked the code, we got job offer after job offer.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I didn't accept any of those jobs. I decided to co-found a
          startup called PBWiki, then I moved on to start I Will Teach You To Be
          Rich, where I've spent 15 years building a diverse team of top
          performers and teaching millions of readers how to live a Rich Life.
        </p>
        <p>
          As CEO of I Will Teach You To Be Rich, I found myself on the other
          side of the hiring table. And I brought everything I'd learned about
          hiring with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          While building my team, I quietly took notes on what the BEST
          candidates did...as well as all of the deal-killing mistakes that 99%
          of applicants made (over and over). I noted what senior candidates did
          that junior candidates always missed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I was sitting on the other side of the table, I could see WHY
          all the techniques my friends and I discovered worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, I started sharing my system with friends to test it on
          people less obsessed with hiring than I was. Sure enough, one by one,
          they used the same steps to land 6-figure jobs, earn major promotions,
          get remote work, and accelerate their careers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I was hooked. I made the leap. 10 years ago, I finally put
          everything I'd learned into a comprehensive, step-by-step program.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> was born. It was an instant hit. THOUSANDS
          of people joined, and I got flooded with amazing success stories from
          students who used my system to land their Dream Job, earn more, and
          enjoy amazing perks.

                For example, a good friend of mine from college asked me when I
                was going to come down and visit him down in the Florida
                panhandle. The next week I had booked tickets for a 10-day trip
                to enjoy some golf and time spent on the beach all without
                skipping a beat at work.
              </p>
              <p>
                That flexibility has allowed me to take golf trips like that to
                Scottsdale and Palm Springs over the last few years — and even

            How do they do it? Are they just lucky? Are they a smooth talker?
            What else?

          <li>
            When you ask your friends how work is, do they shrug and say
            "Meh...it’s a job," or do they get excited and talk about the latest
            cool new project they're working on?

        <p>
          I know how hard it can be to take a hard look at our own career and
          admit that it’s not what we dreamed about.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work hard, try to speak up and get ahead...but it's like we're
          running uphill.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's like we're all playing a high-stakes game...but the rules are
          hidden and only a few people seem to know what they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a CEO, I've reviewed thousands of applicants for all types and
          levels of positions, and even today, I'm still shocked by all the
          career mistakes most people make — and never even realize it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I see a whole generation of people who feel "stuck" and don't even
          know why.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also know there are some specific things you can do
          <b>right now</b> to completely change the trajectory of your career.

        <h2>6 invisible scripts holding you back</h2>
        <p>
          Looking for a job isn't fun. It can be scary, overwhelming, boring,
          nerve-wracking. And that's when it's going well! A job search actually
          dredges up a lot of deep and confusing feelings we'd rather ignore
          (like...“What am I doing with my life?”).
        </p>
        <p>
          I always start with the psychology. Because I can give you the perfect
          tactics — hell, I can even fly to your house and coach you myself —
          but until you understand your own inner psychology, you’ll always be
          stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let’s do this together. I’m going to show you 6 “invisible
          scripts,” or unconscious beliefs that some people have.
        </p>
        <p>As you read, take a hard look to see which of these apply to you.</p>

        <h2>The haunting reality of “settling” for your job</h2>
        <p>
          Most people start their careers eager to work — eager to accomplish
          something. We’re willing to put in the time if we know there’s a
          reward at the end of the tunnel!
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to make an impact. We want to make more, learn more, and do
          meaningful work.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we want the rewards, too. We want to earn enough to live a Rich
          Life, one where we’re not constantly stressed about every single thing
          we buy. I want to be able to take a weekend getaway. I want to be able
          to pick up the tab for the people I love. And sometimes, I want to buy
          something nice for myself <b>just because</b>.
        </p>
        <p>And most people are actually willing to work hard to get this!</p>
        <p>
          <b>That’s how a lot of careers started.</b> (Did it start that way for
          you?)
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first few years, if you're ambitious and smart — and with a
          little luck — you'll probably be able to achieve some level of
          success. A promotion or two. A raise.
        </p>
        <p>
          You start to be able to do small things for yourself. You splurge for
          the guac at Chipotle.

        <p>
          But by the time you reach your 30s, you can start to see people’s
          career paths diverge: Some people keep rising. And some stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people settle. No, I didn’t really want to do this...and I don’t
          love the lifestyle...but it's a job, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people hit the “Chipotle level” and stay there for the rest of
          their lives. They can do something nice once in a while — but that’s
          about it. They’re stuck in the middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          And isn’t Chipotle fine, anyway? Most of us have pretty good lives. We
          can watch HBO Max, we can get food delivered via Postmates, and we can
          see our friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I want options. To do more, travel more, experience new things. To
          live a life of adventure, not to limit myself at guacamole.
        </p>
        <p>We settle. And we can notice the clues in our own careers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How do you feel on Sunday afternoons? Are they just a slow,
            depressing countdown to Monday and the boring week ahead?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do you consider yourself lucky to get a tiny raise every couple
            years?
          </li>
          <li>
            When someone asks, “How’s work?” do you answer back with a
            depressing answer? (The most common: “It’s a job” or “Work’s
            work”...[sigh])
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's a name for this.</p>

        <p>The "normal" job search is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="li-x">
            <b>Passive:</b> You surrender all your control to the algorithms
            behind Monster.com and Indeed.com. Or to the gatekeepers thumbing
            through hundreds of identical resumes before they go to lunch. Will
            you get lucky?
          </li>
          <li class="li-x">
            <b>Slow:</b> 60% of the normal job search is just waiting around for
            someone — anyone — to reply. :(
          </li>
          <li class="li-x">
            <b>Broken!</b> This is the worst part. By following the normal
            approach, applicants actually DECREASE their odds of success. They
            are unknowingly telling hiring managers that they are not top
            quality candidates and can be safely ignored.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          NO WONDER this approach rarely results in finding a good job — one
          that's high-paying, flexible, and rewarding — let alone a Dream Job.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Now, compare that to how Top Talent approaches the job hunt.</b>
        </p>
        <p>First, they don't follow the normal application process.</p>
        <p>
          Instead of applying to any and every job they can find, they focus all
          their efforts on great jobs at great companies that will fit their
          career goals. This saves time, cuts stress, and improves results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then they apply through "quiet entryways" into the company where their
          resume gets floated to the top of the pile. (I'll show you how.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, they know how to stand out in their interviews so they don't
          just get an offer but start at the top of their pay band.

          This Dream Job System is a totally different way of finding a job.
          It's:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="li-check">
            <b>Proactive:</b> Instead of delegating all of your power and
            control to job board algorithms, gatekeepers, and sheer luck, you
            start with your Rich Life and work backward to find the Dream Job
            for you.
          </li>
          <li class="li-check">
            <b>Fast:</b> My students are often surprised at how fast this
            process works. It's amazing how much time you can save when you're
            not shotgunning out generic resumes and waiting around for something
            to happen.
          </li>
          <li class="li-check">
            <b>Repeatable:</b> This works for your next Dream Job. What’s more,
            you can use it again and again. For example, you can land multiple
            offers and engineer a “bidding war” (I show you exactly how). And in
            a few years, if you decide to switch to a different job — or even a
            different industry — you can use this system to do it again.

          And in true IWT fashion, I've eliminated all the BS, all the detours,
          and all the marginal wins that just give tiny or one-off blips but

        <p>
          You don't have to surrender your career, your ambition, or your Rich
          Life to the whims of your boss or the company you happen to work at.

          program. This has worked with thousands of students and we know it’ll
          work for you.

        <p>
          In the totally new program, we've recorded live makeovers with real
          people to capture the “aha” moments that change career trajectories.
          And we’ve spent over 10+ years helping thousands of students find
          their Dream Jobs. <b>Now it’s your turn.</b>

        <h2>How is <i>Dream Job</i> different?</h2>
        <p>First, proof matters.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> is the ONLY career program proven over 10+
          YEARS and thousands of students. You don't build that kind of track
          record by accident.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve helped thousands of people find their Dream Jobs and live their
          own Rich Lives. That means we continually get access to massive
          amounts of data on what really works in today's competitive job
          market, which we include in the program. For example, we know the
          interview questions people are getting asked — and we share winning
          answers right in
          <i>Find Your Dream Job</i>.
        </p>
        <p>Second, systems matter.</p>
        <p>
          It's not enough for one person to land a great job. Maybe they’re
          special. Maybe they had a lucky interview. We’ve tested and tested
          this program — with different industries, different ages, different
          income levels — until it was repeatable and streamlined. Now you get
          the very best of our material.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're wondering whether <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> will work for
          40-somethings, stay-at-home parents, international students, men,
          women, BIPOC, senior-level candidates, new graduates, and everything
          in between, the answer is…
        </p>
        <p>YES! WE TESTED EVERY STRATEGY, TACTIC, AND SCRIPT IN THE PROGRAM!</p>
        <p>
          Not once. Not twice. We've tested them for 10+ years with thousands of
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> works for all of those categories, and
          more. Our Dream Job System will work for you.

              too much time worrying about why you haven't landed a job yet, you
              just move on to the next step.”

        <h2>Introducing the <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> Playbooks</h2>
        <p>
          We’ve pioneered a new way to give you even more material to find and
          land your Dream Job. We call them <i>Dream Job Playbooks</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The old way:</b> In the past, other programs gave you an exhausting
          list of videos, PDFs, and cobbled-together “bonus material.” It was
          easy to log in and be impressed by the quantity of information, but
          where do you start?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The new way:</b> We reinvented career training from the ground up.
          Each <i>Dream Job </i>Playbook is a <u>complete</u>, <u>current</u>,
          and <u>step-by-step</u> SYSTEM for accomplishing a major milestone in
          finding and landing your Dream Job.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you want to know about interviewing, use the
          <i>Dream Job</i> Playbook on interviewing, which includes advanced
          techniques for standing out, word-for-word answers to the toughest
          interview questions, step-by-step instructions for what to do before
          and after the interview, and videos of
          <span
            ><b
              >actual hiring managers sharing how they hire and interview</b
            ></span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>No other program gives you this level of specific detail.</p>
        <p>
          No other program includes such an in-depth collection of strategies,
          tactics, and psychology.

          Playbook…long before you ever see it publicly. Behind

          testing, iteration, and improvement.

        <h2>NEW in <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> — Hiring manager confessions</h2>
        <p>
          Next, I brought in actual hiring managers to ask them what they
          <b>wish</b> job seekers knew.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine being a fly on the wall during a private conversation between
          hiring managers.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What do they <b>really</b> look for in a resume or interview?</li>
          <li>
            What types of networking are appreciated vs instant turn-offs?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are they <b>really</b> thinking if a candidate asks for more
            money?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You’ve never seen these hiring manager “confessions”...because
          nobody’s convinced hiring managers to open up and share their hiring
          secrets. Until now.

        <h2>"But my situation is different…!"</h2>
        <p>
          After helping thousands of students over the past 10 years, one thing
          I've learned is that nobody's career path is perfect.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe you've hopped from job to job one too many times.</p>
        <p>Maybe you just hate networking.</p>
        <p>
          Maybe you have a lot of skills, but they just don't seem like the
          right ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve engineered the Dream Job System for you.
          <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> will show you how to turn your weaknesses
          into strengths and land your Dream Job.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why I've packed the program with Inside Talks: straight-talk,
          no-BS coaching sessions in which I answer the thorniest questions job
          searchers face.

                My Rich Life is being able to golf every week with my best
                friends, and I’m now in the process of joining a golf club with
                two of them. I also don’t think twice about ordering takeout for
                my girlfriend and I when we don’t feel like cooking after a long
                day at work. I used to have to check my account balances every
                day. In fact, one time several years ago, I didn’t even have $20
                to cover a takeout bill for myself and a new date. I had to go
                to the bank and sign a withdrawal slip to take out $19.38 then
                scramble for change in my car. It was the most embarrassing
                money moment I’ve ever had.

                The most significant personal advantage of remote work is not
                the lack of commute or the ability to work from home. It’s the
                ability to work from wherever you feel like. Here is what remote
                work has allowed my partner and I to do just this year:

                <li>
                  We also worked from a campground in Banff, Canada. It's one of
                  the most amazing places on Earth….

              </ul>

                The neat thing about having a flexible schedule is that you can
                meet someone during the day….Oh, and here’s me working in my

        <h2>Is <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> right for you?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm extremely selective about who I allow into my programs because I'm
          in the enviable position of not needing to appeal to everyone — just
          the right people. I'd rather work with a small group of people who are
          committed to taking action than a large group of looky-loos who are
          looking for the latest magic bullet.
        </p>
        <p>Please read this carefully, because these rules are ironclad.</p>
        <p>
          <b><i>Find Your Dream Job</i> is NOT for you if...</b>

          <li class="li-x">
            You’re looking for a magic bullet without putting in the challenging
            work — no one's going to just hand you a Dream Job. Work is
            required.
          </li>
          <li class="li-x">
            You've never held a real job and want to make $150,000 by the time
            the course is over. Get-rich-quick schemers, please leave.
          </li>
          <li class="li-x">
            You’re simply looking for “motivation” and “inspiration.” I believe
            the most motivational thing you can do is get RESULTS, so while I’m
            friendly and supportive (or so I’ve been told), I’m ultimately
            concerned with your success. That means I have high expectations and
            expect you to put in the work.
          </li>
          <li class="li-x">
            You have credit card debt. Sorry, your first duty is to pay it off.
            You will not be allowed in until you do, and if I find out you
            joined with CC debt, I will ban you from ever purchasing any of my
            products again. This rule has cost me millions of dollars over the
            last couple of years, but it’s the right thing to do. I’m not
            interested in opening this course to everyone — just the right
            people.

            You’re patient, deliberate, and methodical. You’re committed to
            spending the time to follow the system, and you know this will not
            happen overnight. You know that if you put in 5-10 hours a week and
            do the heavy lifting upfront, you can enjoy the rewards for the rest
            of your working life.

          most expensive of all. A one-time salary increase of $5,000 — properly
          invested — can add up to over a million dollars by the time you
          retire. And that's just one raise. Top performers tend to get raise
          after raise…not to mention the happiness of finding something we
          really excel at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing nothing is the most common choice&nbsp; — and the most haunting.
          How long have you been thinking about a better job? How much longer
          will you wait? How many excuses will you create? If not now, then
          when?

          <b>Let me tell you exactly why I offer this unbeatable guarantee.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          When I researched <i>Find Your Dream Job</i>, I tried all of the
          popular courses in this area only to find that they regurgitated more
          of the same old, rehashed, generic info, focused on minutiae and
          tactics. Most of the “experts” had never found a top job themselves —
          or hired for one —&nbsp; and were just rehashing trite advice that
          doesn't actually work!
        </p>
        <p>
          That's not good enough for me, for I Will Teach You To Be Rich, or for
          my readers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's exactly why I know <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> is worth every
          penny and will help you find and land the job of your dreams:
        </p>
        <div>
          <ol id="ioar2bn" class="c29553">
            <li id="i54dt8g" class="c29561">
              <b>I invested years and over $1,000,000 of my own money</b> into
              developing my system for finding your Dream Job.
            </li>
            <li id="ieya8n1" class="c29588">
              I invited people from across the country, created all-new
              curriculum, tested it, hired top-tier video talent, and put
              together the <b>best lessons anywhere.</b>
            </li>
            <li id="i9bhv3e" class="c29615">
              I tested the system again with an intensive, 2-day live event to
              test everything on students of different ages, genders,
              ethnicities, backgrounds, industries, and goals. Each seat cost
              $12,000 and our students were delighted to pay it.
            </li>
            <li id="i8uq0xp" class="c29624">
              Then I
              <b
                >tested the whole program again — from beginning to end with
                thousands of students —</b
              >
              many who started with no idea what their Dream Jobs were or how
              they could make substantially more money. But they could...and
              they did.
            </li>
            <li id="i5s8xz8" class="c29660">
              <b>My system worked. But I didn’t stop there.</b> I kept refining,
              streamlining, and improving the systems I was teaching. Over 10+
              years, I collected hundreds of thousands of data points and I
              personally spoke with thousands of students at every step of the
              process.
            </li>
            <li id="ii9d4e2" class="c29687">
              Then we pulled out everything that was even remotely confusing or
              difficult and rebuilt it from scratch. We iterated and tested all
              over again to make the <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> system
              <b data-highlightable="1">as fast and effective as possible.</b>
            </li>
            <li id="im3dvkk" class="c29714">
              We also <b>doubled down on everything that worked:</b> simpler
              systems, more powerful strategies, more word-for-word scripts,
              more teardowns, more behind-the-scenes insights.
            </li>
            <li id="iljhuvv" class="c29750">
              And we collected
              <b
                >real resumes, cover letters, and proposals that led to Dream
                Jobs and 6-figure salaries</b
              >
              and included them in the program for you.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          This is why I know that <i>Find Your Dream Job</i> works. Our
          graduates know. Now it’s up to you to decide if you want to invest in
          yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I only care about developing super high-quality programs full of
          proven strategies, systems, psychological tactics, scripts, and more
          that you can't find anywhere else.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why my blog has been around for 15+ years and hosts over
          850,000 readers per month.
        </p>
        <p>That's why my book is a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller — twice.</p>
        <p>And that's why I guarantee <i>Find Your Dream Job</i>.</p>
        <p>
          It's simple: Take the course and see for yourself. If it doesn't work,
          I want you to email me, show me you did the work, and I'll refund you
          100%.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guarantee is extended for a full 60 days, which is more than
          enough time to go through every Playbook. Try the ENTIRE program. If
          you don't love it, just email me at ANY TIME during the first 60 days
          and show me you're doing the exercises and not getting results. I'll
          refund 100% of your payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, I ask you to show me you've done the exercises because I
          know how powerful they can be when applied. I have no intention of
          keeping your money if you're dissatisfied, but I insist that you
          commit to taking action if you want the results from this program.
          I've spent millions developing the material in here and our other
          programs, and I'd like to share it with you if you're ready to use
          this material to find your Dream Job, nail the interview, make more
          money, and start living the life you want.

        <h2>This is a pivotal moment in your life — what will you choose?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most fascinating quirks of human psychology is that we can
          be dissatisfied for a LONG TIME before we actually <b>do</b> anything.
          How many of us know someone stuck in a bad job for the last 10 years?
          A bad living situation? A bad <i>marriage</i>?
        </p>
        <p>This is painfully clear when it comes to our careers.</p>
        <p>
          Day after day, week after week, we go to jobs we don't like, for less
          pay than we're worth, silently enduring the pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a reason you know what dreading Monday mornings feels like.
          There's a reason you can't wait until Friday afternoon. There's a
          reason you're still reading this page.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >You <u>know</u> something better is possible. You know it’s
            possible to feel fulfilled, secure, inspired, and most of all,
            valued at work.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people live their entire lives like this. They settle and spend
          the next 20, 30, 40 years trudging along, phoning it in. Trying not to
          think about everything that could have been.
        </p>
        <p>
          But every once in a while, we hit a pivotal moment that wakes us up. A
          pivotal moment that gives us a choice:
        </p>
        <div class="spacer c79201"></div>
        <h4 id="i779a3e" class="c30183 text-uppercase font-family-euclid">
          <span class="c58775"
            >Do you want to keep doing what you've done?</span
          >
        </h4>
        <div class="spacer c79123"></div>
        <h4 id="iymwjco" class="c30201 text-uppercase font-family-euclid">
          <span class="c58829">Or are you ready to make a change?</span>
        </h4>
        <div class="spacer c74280 spacer-50"></div>
        <p>
          Each of us only gets a handful of these pivotal moments. A handful of
          chances to stop and take our careers in a new direction. Once these
          pivotal moments pass, if we don't take action, the opportunity is gone
          and we lose ourselves in the day-to-day hustle again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until the next pivotal moment hits. But we all get a very limited
          number of opportunities. Maybe you've already used up some of yours.
        </p>
        <p>How many have you already used up?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You got passed up for the promotion again...for someone else with
            less experience than you
          </li>
          <li>You’re worried about being laid off</li>
          <li>
            You're tired of hearing about your friend's job that pays better,
            sounds much more interesting, and comes with 3 extra weeks of
            vacation
          </li>
          <li>
            Your partner lost their job and now you're the sole breadwinner
            (what now?)
          </li>
          <li>
            You're starting a family and suddenly realize you need a bigger
            salary and better health insurance
          </li>
          <li>
            You've been working for a few years and realize you haven't
            accomplished anywhere near as much as you hoped or planned for
          </li>
          <li>
            You're hitting a new decade — your 30s, your 40s, your 50s — and
            can't help but wonder "Is this it?"
          </li>
          <li>
            You've realized you've maxed out your potential at your current
            company. There's just&nbsp; nothing more you can earn or learn
          </li>
          <li>
            You're fed up with wasting an hour a day commuting back and forth to
            the office
          </li>
          <li>
            You had a great job...then you got a new boss and they suck. Now you
            hate your job
          </li>
          <li>
            You had another annual review and realized your current path is a
            dead end. No raise, no new skills, no promotion. Just another year
            of the same old grind
          </li>
          <li>
            You've had someone pull back the curtain on all the mistakes you're
            making in your career and your job searches — offering you a better
            way
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Pivotal moments like these can be painful, but they can also be the
          push we need to take action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next Monday, you'll be facing another day at your job. Another week
          just like the last week. And the one before that. Does that excite
          you?
        </p>
        <p>What are you going to do about it?</p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, we need a little nudge from someone who believes in us more
          than even we believe in ourselves. Someone who can encourage us, guide
          us — someone who's been there.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that years from now, looking back on our lives, we don't look back
          with regret and confess, "I wish I'd believed in myself enough to try
          that. I wish I'd at least tried."
        </p>
        <p>I believe in you.</p>
        <p>
          I believe in you because I've helped thousands of people like you find
          their Dream Jobs and start living their own Rich Lives — even when
          they didn't think it was possible.

                I was laid off from a tech startup in January 2019….Fortunately,

                identified my dream company, one of the largest tech
                organizations in the world. Then, to make myself stand out, I
                knew I would have to have a bulletproof portfolio….

                At the end of the day, I was offered a job at one of the most

                salary, 2-year bonus package, and stock options. None of this

        <h2>It's time to decide</h2>
        <p>
          We all know we have a small "window" where we have the biggest chance
          to make a change in our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year, that window gets narrower and narrower. It becomes harder
          and harder to catch up with those who took action years ago. It
          becomes more discouraging to try something new. 6 months from now...if
          you still haven't signed up...what will you think? Will you be better
          off? Will you have spent your time doing something useful?
        </p>
        <p>
          Look, it's OK if you don't know what your Dream Job is or if you
          aren't sure how to get it. That's normal. But every step you make
          should be systematically moving you closer toward discovering it — or
          what are we doing with our lives?
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, it's confusing. Of COURSE it's a little overwhelming. But it's
          SUPPOSED to be hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          When handed a map to navigate toward greatness, will you take it? Or
          will you get around to it "later" — and let your potential slip away?
        </p>
        <p>
          What a shame to stay stagnant. What a shame to let our dreams pass us
          by, and one day, to realize our best years are behind us.
        </p>
        <p>Now, if this course is genuinely not for you, I respect that.</p>
        <p>
          But if it is — if you really want to love what you do, to get paid
          what you're worth, and to enjoy a career tailor-made to fit your
          lifestyle and goals — it's time to decide.
